## Analytics

Analytics is a way for you to track how users interact with your data. 

### Configuration

Initialize the `availity.config` module in your application. 

```javascript
angular.module('app', ['availity.config']);
```

### Virtual Page Tracking

Virtual page tracking is enabled by default.  Virtual page can be disabled using `avAnalyticsConfigProvider`.

```javascript
app.config( ($scope, avAnalyticsConfigProvider) => {
    avAnalyticsConfigProvider.setVirtualPageTracking(true);
});
```

### Anatomy of an Event

> The following descriptions were copied from [http://www.statstory.com/](http://www.statstory.com/tracking-events-in-google-analytics/)

* **category** - This is the name you want to give for the collection where actions you want to track will occur. An example of category could be Videoâ€™s or Datasheets.  Categories are useful for grouping events in analytics reports.
* **label** - This is an optional string which can be valuable in adding a dimension to the event data. Usually I use it to differentiate content. For example, if you want to know which specific video is played or which datasheet is downloaded.
* **action** - This is a string which is paired with each category, and most often is used to describe the user interaction with your content. An example could be play, click or download.
* **value** - This is a number, which you can use to provide a numerical dimension to a user action. Normally, I leave this blank unless I have an e-commerce reason. For example if you have a form, where a user can fill in a price or quantity, you can pass this value via an event.

### Event Tracking

To add event tracking to an element on the page you will need to use the `av-analytics-on` directive. When applying analytics  you should include the `av-analytics-on` directive on the element you want to track, this will pull the inner text of the element and set it as a label. Optionally if no inner text exists, include the `av-analytics-label` attribute on the element . There are also two optional attributes `av-analytics-value`, `av-analytics-category` that you can append to an element for more detailed events.

* **av-analytics** - required for tracking analytics, you can set your category on this directive
* **av-analytics-on** - required for tracking analytics, defaults to `click`
* **av-analytics-label** - required for Piwik
* **av-analytics-action** - optional for Piwik
* **av-analytics-value** - optional for Piwik - numeric only

The example below will demonstrate how to use the directive. 

```html
<div av-analytics="{'category': 'Category One'}">
    <button
        av-analytics-on
        av-analytics-label="Intro Movie"
        av-analytics-action="Play"
        av-analytics-value="0">
    Button
    </button>
</div>
```

### Plugins

To register a new analytic service you would call `analyticsProvider.registerPlugins()` passing in a array of services you want to register.

```javascript
app.config( avAnalyticsProvider => {
    avAnalyticsProvider.registerPlugins([
      'test1AnalyticService',
      'test2AnalyticService'
    ]);
});
```

### Exception Handler

The Angular `$exceptionHandler` has been enhanced using [Tracekit](https://github.com/csnover/TraceKit) for consistent metrics on stack traces occurring across all browsers.

Below is an example of an an error event when captured through the exception handler.

```javascript
// sample payload

{
"level": "error",
"entries": {
    "errorDate": "2015-06-21T19:21:17.283Z",
    "errorName": "Error",
    "errorMessage": "Oh snap!",
    "errorStack": "[00] Object.$scope.analytics.createError http://localhost:3000/js/docs-demos.js:46:15\n[01] Parser.functionCall http://
    ...
    ...",
    "appId": "N/A",
    "userAgent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_5) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/43.0.2357.81 Safari/537.36",
    "referrer": "http://localhost:3000/core.html",
    "host": "localhost",
    "screenWidth": 744,
    "screenHeight": 723,
    "sdkVersion": "v0.0.0"
    }
}

```
