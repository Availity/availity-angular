  ### availity._stringify()
  Converts any object into a string
  </div>

  <div data-markdown>
  ### availity.uuid()

  _Copied from Angular_.  A consistent way of creating unique IDs. The ID is a sequence of alpha numeric characters such as '012ABC'. The reason why we are not using simply a number counter is that the number string gets longer over time, and it can also overflow, where as the nextId will grow much slower, it is a string, and it will never overflow.
