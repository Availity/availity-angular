<div data-markdown>
* `availity.print()` - Utility method that fixes `window.print()` for IE8-11 and Firefox from within an `<iframe>`
* `availity._stringify()` - Converts any object into a string
* `availity.uuid()` - **Copied from Angular**.  A consistent way of creating unique IDs. The ID is a sequence of alpha numeric characters such as '012ABC'. The reason why we are not using simply a number counter is that the number string gets longer over time, and it can also overflow, where as the nextId will grow much slower, it is a string, and it will never overflow.
